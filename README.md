# nuremberg_trials_search_engine
 A search engine for navigating the Nuremberg Trials. Developed using Python3, Whoosh and Flask.<br>
 A demo video is available here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qDYBawAha0qJwCjquQ-vpIhrxtcjt8Js/view">Google Drive</a>
 <br>
 Make sure you install Whoosh and Flask using the following commands:
 ```
 pip install whoosh
 pip install flask
 ```
 Open a terminal in the project's root then type-in:
 ```
 python main.py
 ```
 The application therefore will run on:
